# This function is here so that we use the most up-to-date --color flags in the template sh file for every invocation.
#
# fzf can only be configured via --color flags, which is what the template sh file does via appending to
# $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
# This results in FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS growing in length for every invocation of fzf.
#
# Thus, we'll stash its current contents & revert to it after executing fzf.
local _previous_fzf_opts=$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
[[ -f ~/.config/tinted-theming/fzf.sh ]] && source ~/.config/tinted-theming/fzf.sh
command fzf "$@"

# Revert back to previous FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS value.
